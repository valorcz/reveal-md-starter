# reveal-md-starter

A simple attempt to kickstart a slide creation with
[reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) project.

## Enabled Reveal.js plugins

When I was checking the whoel Reveal.js universe, some of the plugins seemed
very useful. Therefore, I'd like to use them in my slide decks too!

Here's the list of what are my plugins of selection:

* Chalkboard
* Charts
* Menu

## Known issues

You can check [notes.md](notes.md) for some TODO and known bugs, and so on.
