## TODO

* `static` target doesn't work well yet, as the `reveal-md` generator
  only transmits the selected .css and .js files, not the rest of the
  folder. That breaks the static functionality.
* charting doesn't work either, as I need to figure out how to convince
  `reveal-md` to pass my HTML directly to the output.
